      <h1>Redefining Cybersecurity, One Curious Mind at a Time.</h1>
      <h2>Culture-first cybersecurity strategies. Cutting-edge insights.</h2>
      <p> Welcome to the home of cyber curiosity. I’m Lakeidra Smith—bestselling author, educator, cybersecurity consultant, and your go-to for human-centered strategies that actually stick. 
        You won’t find cookie-cutter solutions here. I partner with organizations ready to move beyond checkbox compliance and create human-centered, culture-driven security strategies.

        <br> <br> I’m not just a consultant; I’m a thought leader. I’m here to help you understand the “why” behind the “what.” I’ll help you turn your employees into your greatest cybersecurity asset.

        <br> <br> Whether you’re a corporate leader tired of cookie-cutter security advice, an event organizer looking for a speaker who electrifies the room, or a CISO trying to shift your company's security culture—I’ve got you covered.

       <br> <br> Forget fear-based tactics. I’ll help you turn curiosity into your company's greatest cybersecurity asset.</p>

       <p> Whether you’re a corporate leader tired of generic advice, an event organizer in need of an unforgettable speaker, or a CISO committed to reshaping company culture—you’re in the right place.

        <h1>Keynotes That Make Cybersecurity Make Sense—And Make an Impact.</h1>
        <p>Let’s get one thing clear—I’m not here to bore your audience with death-by-PowerPoint.

            I deliver keynote talks and workshops that blend real-life cybercrime stories, insider industry insights, and relatable, actionable strategies your audience won’t forget. 
            
            My style? Sharp, witty, and rooted in research, but always approachable. 
            
            Whether it’s Fortune 500 execs, IT pros, or a conference full of hungry learners, I leave them thinking differently about cybersecurity.
