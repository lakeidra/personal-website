      <h1>Redefining Cybersecurity, One Curious Mind at a Time.</h1>
      <h2>Culture-first cybersecurity strategies. Cutting-edge insights.</h2>
      <p> Welcome to the home of cyber curiosity. I’m Lakeidra Smith—bestselling author, educator, cybersecurity consultant, and your go-to for human-centered strategies that actually stick. 
        You won’t find cookie-cutter solutions here. I partner with organizations ready to move beyond checkbox compliance and create human-centered, culture-driven security strategies.

        <br> <br> I’m not just a consultant; I’m a thought leader. I’m here to help you understand the “why” behind the “what.” I’ll help you turn your employees into your greatest cybersecurity asset.

        <br> <br> Whether you’re a corporate leader tired of cookie-cutter security advice, an event organizer looking for a speaker who electrifies the room, or a CISO trying to shift your company's security culture—I’ve got you covered.

       <br> <br> Forget fear-based tactics. I’ll help you turn curiosity into your company's greatest cybersecurity asset.</p>

       <p> Whether you’re a corporate leader tired of generic advice, an event organizer in need of an unforgettable speaker, or a CISO committed to reshaping company culture—you’re in the right place.
