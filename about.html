        <h2>Meet Lakeidra: Cybersecurity, but Make It Human, Bold & Brilliant.</h2>
        <p>I’m Lakeidra Smith—author of Cyber Curiosity, corporate trainer, and consultant trusted by companies who want real change, not recycled jargon.
          My approach? Straightforward, research-backed, and rooted in one belief: Your people—not your software—are your strongest defense. That’s why I specialize in human-centric cybersecurity strategies that actually stick.

          <br> <br>  Years in the cybersecurity trenches taught me one thing:  99% of security breaches are human error.
          I'm not your typical cybersecurity expert—and that’s the point.
          I don't just talk about technology—I talk about people. About culture. About why your employees clicking that suspicious link isn't just an IT problem; it’s a company culture problem.
          From boardrooms to breakout sessions, I connect culture to security, psychology to policy, and mindset to behavior. I’m here to help organizations build curiosity-driven cultures that don't just react to cyber threats—they anticipate and outsmart them.
